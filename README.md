# Sudoku Game - Programming Project

## Introduction
Sudoku is a number puzzle game that is played on a 9x9 grid. The grid is divided into 9 smaller 3x3 grids, called boxes. The objective of the game is to fill in the grid with the numbers 1-9 such that each row, column, and box contains all of the numbers 1-9 without repetition.

The game starts with some of the squares in the grid already filled in. These are called "clues" and are used as a starting point to solve the puzzle. Players must use logical reasoning and deduction to fill in the rest of the grid.

To play, players must first scan the grid for any obvious moves, such as a number that can only go in one specific square. They can then use this information to deduce where other numbers should go. They can also use the process of elimination to determine which numbers can be placed in a particular square.

The game is won when the player has successfully filled in the entire grid without breaking any of the rules.
